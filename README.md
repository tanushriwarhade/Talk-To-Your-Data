# 🧠 Natural Language → SQL Reasoning System

Ask questions in plain English and get:
- 🧩 Explicit reasoning
- 🧾 Safe SQL queries
- 📊 Correct database results

This project **does not translate text to SQL directly**.  
Instead, it **reasons step-by-step** like a human data analyst.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?

Naïve text-to-SQL systems often fail because they:
- Hallucinate table or column names
- Guess when queries are ambiguous (e.g., “recent”, “best”)
- Generate unsafe or inefficient SQL
- Provide no explanation of how the query was formed

👉 **Our solution fixes this by reasoning first, then generating SQL.**

## 🧠 Core Idea

> **Reason → Plan → Generate SQL → Validate → Execute**

The system explicitly:
1. Detects user intent  
2. Explores database schema  
3. Builds a reasoning plan  
4. Generates safe, read-only SQL  
5. Validates the query  
6. Executes and explains results

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Natural language questions
- ✅ Explicit reasoning plans
- ✅ Multi-step query handling (joins, aggregations)
- ✅ Ambiguity detection & clarification
- ✅ Schema introspection (meta queries)
- ✅ Safe SQL execution (read-only, no SELECT *)
- ✅ Web UI + CLI fallback

---

## 🧪 Example Queries

Try these in the system:

- `How many customers are from Brazil?`
- `Which customers have never made a purchase?`
- `What tables exist in this database?`
- `Show me recent orders`
- `Show me orders from the last 30 days`
